I’ve spent most of my career as a software developer, focused on programming, SQL databases, and building e-commerce–style front ends. However, I’ve never truly enjoyed that type of work — my real interest has always been in visual creativity, especially 3D animation, VFX, and game graphics.
I’m using Linux and prefer free MIT licenced tools. I’d like to start learning how to create visually rich scenes, procedural effects, and/or interactive 3D experiences, combining my programming background with artistic expression.
Please:
    1. Suggest a realistic beginner-friendly roadmap for transitioning into 3D graphics, VFX, or real-time animation, tailored for Linux.
    2. Recommend which tools to focus on first and how they fit together.
    3. Provide step-by-step starter instructions or a short 7-day learning plan that balances coding and creativity.
    4. Include optional project ideas that can help me quickly build a visually appealing portfolio.
Keep the tone encouraging and concise, assuming I’m an experienced programmer but a beginner in 3D graphics or VFX.
Focus more on procedural animation, particles, physics simulations, and Geometry Nodes or scripting.
